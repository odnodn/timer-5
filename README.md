Fork: refactored `multi timer with round labs` version from `angular` -> `react` / shadcn / zustand

# Timer

[Timer](https://klaster1.github.io/timer-5) is a simple time tracking tool. Create a task, click "Start"/"Stop", see how much the task took, repeat.

All the data is kept in the `localStorage`, it does not leave your device, ever. To manage the data, use "Export" (to JSON) and "Import" features. A test data set can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Klaster1/a456beaf5384924fa960790160286d8a/raw/179c67dad43c66d48fb7c766f1e19b58df4c64cf/games.json).
